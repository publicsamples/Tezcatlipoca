# Tezcatlipoca

An oddball drum replacement effect. 


Tezcatlipoca takes an input signal and attempts to perform a crude kind of drum replacement. The orginal signal is passed through a multi-mode filter, into an envelope follower that is triggering a sample. Four channels are provided, allowing you to build up complex patterns from a single input. 


- 4 experimental drum replacement channels
- 9 complex modulators
- Syncable sample players

CURRENT STATUS: A fine idea that doesn't really work in practice, the process of tweaking the trigger inputs is extremely fiddlesome. Needs more work.
