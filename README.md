# Tezcatlipoca

Imagine 8 tape recorders/delay buffers with crossfaders on both the input and output channels. This is what we have here. Sonically, it's somewhere between a delay, looper or buffer glitcher. 

Tezcatlipoca is built with [HISE](http://hise.audio).
# Features 

- 8 crossfadeable sample buffers  
- 3 Delay modes. Clean, tape and granular
-  Multi-stage filter and pan
