# Tezcatlipoca

An oddball drum replacement effect. 

Tezcatlipoca takes an input signal and attempts to perform a crude kind of drum replacement. The orginal signal is passed through a multi-mode filter, into an envelope follower that is triggering a sample. Four channels are provided, allowing you to build up complex patterns from a single input. 


- 4 experimental drum replacement channels
- 6 complex modulators
- Syncable sample players
